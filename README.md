WPaaS: WPAR Platform as a Service for POWER platform
====================================================

This project aims to leverage AIX WPAR container so they can be:<br/>
	- Managed with a standard REST interface<br/>
	- Be managed from OpenStack (Havana)</br>

<br />
AIX WPAR ReST APIs, incl. Nova driver for OpenStack.<br />
Glance repository can be used to push images to the WPARRIP hypervisor.<br />
<br />
The 'driver' repository contains the Nova driver for the WPARs.<br />
It uses the WPARRIP ReST API to manage the WPARs and LPAR host.<br />
<br />
The 'wpars' repository contains the WPARRIP code.<br />
Its goal is to provide ReST APIs to manage the WPARs and
get some info on the LPAR host.<br />
<br />
<h3>Features:</h3>
	- Spawn a WPAR with Network and Image information<br />
	- Start a WPAR<br />
	- Stop a WPAR<br />
	- Delete a WPAR<br />
<br />
<h3>Status:</h3>
	- the code works, and a WPAR can be deployed using OpenStack Havana.<br />
<br />
<h3>TODO List:</h3>
	- Use the uploaded image so the WPAR can be created/configured with the image<br />
	- Support other WPAR actions<br />
	- Attach a volume to a WPAR<br />
	- VNC connection to the WPAR<br />
<br />
